# Kef-needy-students-donation-app
An interactive to enhance donations for needy Kenyan students. The app is to encourage and enable people all over the world to assist needy and hardworking students to continue with high school education and brighten their future
In Kenya Education is not free especially high school. This usually leads to many bright students dropping out inspite having good grades and their parents being unable to cater for their Education. This is why kef came through to help such students and give them hope for a better future.
